            <h4>Circa 2020</h4>

                Photojournalism project done during a program with the New York Times Summer Journalism program. 
                Curated during the height of the pandemic, this photo-journalism piece centers on one doctor (Cindy Klipfel) and her 
                experience with the daily struggles of being in children's healthcare during the virus' beginning.

        <h4> August 2020 - East Greenwich Pediatrics </h4>
        <p> 
            Before COVID-19, East Greenwich Pediatrics had a thriving community of families who moved through their busy doors each day.
            They took time and care with each one of them, ensuring that the children received the best care possible. 
            Early on in January the staff, most notably Dr. McMillan,  sensed an urgency from the news of the spread of the virus. 
            They ordered N95 masks, gowns, and extra supplies in case it came to the United States. When it did, they were prepared. 
            For months they had a rotating schedule, with two ‘pods’ of doctors and nurses per week, one who would be at home conducting 
            tele-health visits, and the other who would see patients. Now they have finally switched to a more regular schedule, 
            but life in the office is still greatly impacted by the pandemic. Patients at first were less willing to come to the 
            office, but doctors worked out tele-health visits to keep both patient and doctor safe. Tele-health is an online platform 
            much like face-time or zoom that creates a face-to-face connection with doctor and patient. 
            Its widespread use has been enormously helpful in continuing care during these unprecedented times, 
            although the occasional glitch in connection can make it hard.
        </p>
        <p>
            The help of technology is immense, as online records also create a platform where work can be done from home. 
            However now that patients feel more comfortable coming into the office, their day is fully scheduled. Yearly 
            well-visits and vaccinations that had been postponed, are now trying to be reworked into the schedule.  
            Dr. Klipfel is one of the four hardworking doctors at East Greenwich Pediatrics. She works four days a week and 
            one weekend a month, with ten hour shifts in the office each day. On this day, she tested 12 patients in the tent 
            in the morning, and saw 9 patients in the office in the afternoon. In between, she has a 30 minute break for lunch 
            during which she makes up for phone calls that have been piling up since 8am. The work is hard, but the outcome is 
            rewarding, as Rhode Island has been one of the most ‘corona safe’ states in all of the United States. There is a lot 
            of work to do, but East Greenwich Pediatrics is doing their share of creating a safe place for their community.

            In the 'gown room,' N95 masks are hung on the walls, as if a part of the artwork. In this room the staff don their 
            protective gear, staying safe from COVID-19. The masks are hung, as the staff and doctors are forced to use a mask 
            for the whole week, rather than switching between patients as should be standard in this situation. 
            The mask shortages make it hard to rotate as frequently.

            Danielle and Jamie, medical assistants, put up the third wall of the testing tent to keep in the AC. The day recorded 
            temperatures over 100 degrees, and the flimsy air conditioner doesn't do much.
